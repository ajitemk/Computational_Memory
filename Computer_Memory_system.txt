	 All About computational memory
	The history of computational memory dates back to the early development of computing machines and has evolved significantly
	over time. Here are some key milestones in the history of computational memory:

	Mechanical Calculators (1600s - 1800s):
	 The earliest computational devices were mechanical calculators, such as the abacus and slide rule.
	 These devices used physical components to perform arithmetic and basic calculations,
	 but they did not have a distinct notion of memory as we understand it today.

	Punched Cards (1801): 
	 In the early 19th century, Joseph-Marie Jacquard developed punched cards to control the weaving of patterns in textiles.
	 These cards could be considered one of the earliest forms of computational memory.
	 The patterns of holes in the cards represented instructions and data for the loom.

	Analytical Engine (1837 - 1871):
	 Designed by Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, the Analytical Engine was a theoretical mechanical general-purpose computer.
	 It used punch cards for input and had a form of memory known as the "store."
	 The store held data and intermediate results during calculations, making it one of the earliest instances of memory
	 in a computational device.

	Vacuum Tube-based Memory (1940s - 1950s):
	 The first electronic computers, such as the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC)
	 and the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), used vacuum tubes for computation and memory.
	 The memory was based on the storage of electrical charges in capacitors, and it was volatile,
	 meaning the data was lost when power was turned off.

	Magnetic Drum Memory (1930s - 1950s):
	 Magnetic drum memory was an early form of non-volatile memory that used the rotation of a metal drum with magnetic coating
	 to store data. It was used in computers like the Atanasoff-Berry Computer and the UNIVAC I.

	Magnetic Core Memory (1950s - 1970s):
	 Magnetic core memory became a dominant form of computer memory from the 1950s through the 1970s.
	 It used small magnetic rings, or cores, to represent bits of data.
	 Core memory was faster and more reliable than earlier memory technologies and was widely used in early mainframe computers.

	Semiconductor Memory (1960s - Present):
	 The invention of semiconductor-based memory, particularly dynamic RAM (DRAM) and static RAM (SRAM),
	 revolutionized computer memory. DRAM provided higher density but needed constant refreshing,
	 while SRAM was faster and did not require refreshing but was more expensive.
	 Semiconductor memory rapidly evolved, and today, it is the primary type of memory used in modern computers.

	Cache Memory (1960s - Present):
	 With the introduction of faster CPUs, cache memory was developed to bridge the speed gap between the CPU and main memory
	 (RAM). Cache memory stores frequently accessed data and instructions to reduce the time the CPU spends waiting for data
	 from RAM, improving overall system performance.

	Solid-State Drives (SSDs) and Flash Memory (1980s - Present):
	 Flash memory, a type of non-volatile memory, was developed in the 1980s.
	 It eventually became the basis for solid-state drives (SSDs) used as storage devices in modern computers.
	 SSDs are much faster than traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) and have no moving parts,
	 making them more durable and energy-efficient.

	Future Developments:
	 As technology continues to advance, research and development in computational memory focus on areas such as
	 resistive random-access memory (RRAM), phase-change memory (PCM), and other emerging non-volatile memory technologies.
	 These technologies aim to offer even faster, more energy-efficient, and denser memory solutions for future computing systems.

	The history of computational memory reflects the ongoing quest to develop faster, more reliable,
	and efficient memory technologies to meet the ever-increasing demands of modern computing applications.

	In the context of computer architecture,
	a memory controller is a vital component responsible for managing the data transfer 
	between the central processing unit (CPU)and the computer's memory subsystem.
	Its primary function is to facilitate the smooth and efficient flow of data to and from memory,
	ensuring that the CPU can access data when needed.

	Key responsibilities of a memory controller include:

	Memory Interface: 
					 The memory controller provides an interface between the CPU and the memory modules.
					 It translates the CPU's read and write requests into the appropriate signals required to access the memory,
					 which can be dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), static random-access memory (SRAM), 
					 or other types of memory.

	Address Decoding: 
					 The memory controller decodes the memory addresses generated by the CPU,
					 ensuring that the correct memory module is accessed for each memory request.

	Data Management: 
					 The memory controller handles the transfer of data between the CPU and memory modules.
					 It controls the data flow, including read and write operations, data caching, 
					 and pipelining to minimize access latencies.

	Memory Timing: 	 	
					 Memory modules have specific timing requirements for accessing and storing data.
					 The memory controller manages these timing constraints to ensure data integrity
					 and prevent data corruption.

	Memory Arbitration:
					 In systems with multiple processors or multiple memory modules, 
					 the memory controller may perform memory arbitration.
					 This process determines which processor or component gets priority access to memory
					 when multiple requests are pending.

	Error Correction: 	
					 In some memory controllers,
					 error-correcting code (ECC) is implemented to detect and correct errors that might occur
					 during data transfers. ECC adds extra bits to data to enable error detection and correction.

	Power Management:
					 Modern memory controllers often support power management features to optimize energy consumption.
					 Techniques like low-power modes and dynamic frequency scaling can help reduce power usage
					 when memory demand is low.

	Interfacing with Other Components:
					 The memory controller may also interface with other components,
					such as caches, system buses, and storage devices, to manage data flow effectively.

	Memory controllers are essential in modern computer systems, as they play a crucial role in determining
	the overall system performance. They need to be optimized to handle the increasing demands of data-intensive applications
	and efficiently manage data transfer to keep up with the CPU's processing capabilities.

	It's worth noting that memory controllers can vary significantly depending on the system architecture
	and the type of memory used (e.g., DDR3, DDR4, DDR5).
	Advanced memory controllers continue to be an area of active research and development as computer systems
	strive for improved performance and energy efficiency.

	Q. what are the types of memory controller and how it is interface to processor or controller ?

	A. Memory controllers can be categorized based on the type of memory they manage and the architecture they are designed for.
	   Here are some common types of memory controllers:
	   1. DRAM Memory Controller:
			   DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory) is one of the most widely used types of memory in modern computer systems.
			   DRAM memory controllers are responsible for managing the access and data transfers to and from DRAM modules.
			   They handle the timing, addressing, and data flow to ensure efficient memory access.
			   DRAM controllers are commonly found in systems using DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5 memory.

	   2. SRAM Memory Controller:
			   SRAM (Static Random-Access Memory) is another type of memory, typically faster than DRAM but more expensive
			   and used in smaller capacities. SRAM controllers manage SRAM memory modules,
			   which are commonly used in cache memories and high-performance embedded systems.

	   3. Flash Memory Controller:
			   Flash memory controllers are specific to managing NAND or NOR flash memory devices.
			   These controllers handle the complexities of reading, writing, and erasing data from flash memory,
			   which is commonly used in solid-state drives (SSDs), USB drives, memory cards,
			   and other non-volatile storage devices.

	   4. Graphics Memory Controller:
			   In systems with dedicated graphics processing units (GPUs),
			   a graphics memory controller is used to manage the access to video memory or VRAM.
			   This controller facilitates data transfers between the GPU and video memory,
			   ensuring smooth graphics rendering and performance.

	   5. Integrated Memory Controller (IMC):
			   An integrated memory controller is a specialized memory controller integrated directly into the CPU die.
			   Modern CPUs from companies like Intel and AMD often have an integrated memory controller.
			   It reduces memory latency and improves memory bandwidth by allowing direct communication between the CPU
			   and memory modules, bypassing the need for a separate external memory controller.
			  
	Interface to Processor or Controller:

		The memory controller interfaces with the processor or system bus through specific communication protocols and signals.
		The exact interface can vary depending on the computer architecture and the memory type being used.
		Common interfaces include:

		1. Memory Bus:
				The memory controller connects to the memory modules through a memory bus.
				This bus carries memory address lines, data lines, control signals (e.g., read/write, chip select),
				and timing signals that synchronize data transfers between the memory controller and memory modules.

		2. Processor Bus:
				In systems with an external memory controller (not integrated into the CPU),
				the memory controller interfaces with the processor through the processor bus.
				This could be a front-side bus (FSB) or a modern interconnect like the Intel QuickPath Interconnect (QPI)
				or AMD's Infinity Fabric.

		3. Interconnects (On-chip Memory Controller):
				In CPUs with an integrated memory controller (IMC),
				the memory controller connects directly to the internal cache hierarchy and memory controller of the CPU.
				This direct connection provides faster and more efficient memory access.

		The memory controller must be optimized to handle high-speed data transfers,
		ensure proper timing and synchronization, and manage data flow efficiently.
		It plays a critical role in overall system performance and determines how well the CPU can access
		and utilize the memory subsystem.

	Q. company which produce these memory controller ?

	Q. what is computer memory subsystem ?

	A. The computer memory subsystem, also known as the memory hierarchy,
	   is a hierarchical arrangement of different types of memory within a computer system.
	   Each level of the memory subsystem is designed to balance factors such as speed, capacity, cost, and volatility,
	   aiming to provide the best overall performance and efficiency for data storage and retrieval.
	   The memory subsystem typically consists of the following levels,
	   organized from the fastest and smallest to the slowest and largest:
	   
	   1. CPU Cache:
				The CPU cache is the fastest and most expensive memory in the memory hierarchy.
				It is built directly into the CPU and comes in multiple levels, including L1 (Level 1), L2, and L3 caches.
				The cache stores frequently used data and instructions from the main memory,
				reducing the time the CPU needs to wait for data access.
				The smaller and closer the cache is to the CPU, the faster it can deliver data to the processor.
		
	   2. Main Memory (RAM): 
				Random Access Memory (RAM) is the primary form of volatile memory in a computer.
				It holds data and instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly during program execution.
				RAM is much larger than cache memory but slower.
				It provides a larger workspace for running applications and is responsible for actively holding the 
				operating system and application data when the computer is in use.
				
	   3.Secondary Storage (Hard Drives, Solid-State Drives, etc.):
				Secondary storage refers to non-volatile memory devices,
				such as hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs).
				Unlike RAM and cache, data stored in secondary storage is persistent and does not get lost when the 
				power is turned off. Secondary storage has a much larger capacity than RAM but is slower.
				It is primarily used for long-term storage of files, operating systems, and applications.
				
	   4. Virtual Memory:
				Virtual memory is a technique that allows the operating system to use a portion of the secondary storage
				(usually a designated area on the hard drive or SSD) as an extension of RAM.
				When the physical RAM is insufficient to accommodate all running processes,
				the operating system moves less frequently used data from RAM to the virtual memory space on the secondary storage.
				This allows the computer to continue running programs even when RAM is full,
				though at the cost of reduced performance due to the slower access times of the secondary storage.
				
			from System programer  perceptive
	 From a system programmer's point of view,
	 the computer memory subsystem is a critical aspect of the overall system architecture that heavily influences performance
	 and efficiency. As a system programmer, understanding the memory hierarchy and memory management is essential 
	 for optimizing the system's behavior and ensuring smooth operation of software applications.
	 Here's how system programmers view the computer memory subsystem:
	 
		1. CPU Cache:
			As a system programmer, you need to be aware of the CPU cache's existence,
			organization (L1, L2, L3), and size. You should aim to write code that maximizes cache utilization,
			as accessing data from the cache is much faster than fetching data from RAM.
			Techniques such as loop unrolling, data alignment, and minimizing cache misses can help improve cache performance.
			Additionally, profiling tools and compiler optimization flags can assist in identifying
			and optimizing cache-related issues.
		2. Main Memory (RAM):
			From a system programmer's perspective, managing RAM efficiently is crucial.
			This involves understanding how the operating system allocates and deallocates memory for processes
			and ensuring that there are no memory leaks or excessive memory consumption.
			You might need to monitor memory usage, analyze memory-related performance bottlenecks,
			and tune memory allocation parameters for specific applications or workloads.
		3. Secondary Storage (Hard Drives, Solid-State Drives, etc.):
			As a system programmer, you need to deal with secondary storage when loading programs and data into memory.
			Efficient input/output (I/O) operations become essential to minimize the time spent waiting for data to be read 
			from or written to secondary storage.
			Caching strategies can also be employed to reduce the impact of slower secondary storage on overall
			system performance.	
			
Lets Discuss more about memory from system programmer point of view, like allocation, deallocation,
how can be access memory from a program.

below informatio is from Linux System Programming Talking Directly to the Kernel and C Library by robert love

Memory is the basic resources available to a PROCESS.
 btw allocate memory is a wrong term.
 "conjures up images of rationing a scarce resource for which demand outstrips supply"
 from  means that the word "allocate" implies that memory is a limited resource that must be carefully distributed
 among competing demands. This may have been true in the past when memory was more scarce, but on modern systems,
 the problem is not really one of sharing too little among too many,
 but of properly using and keeping track of the abundance of memory available.
 The line is suggesting that the term "allocate" may not accurately reflect the current state of memory management.
 
 THE PROCESS ADDRESS SPACE :-
 
 the process address space is a unique virtual address space associated with each process in Linux.
 It is linear, starting at zero and increasing contiguously to some maximum value, and is flat,
 existing in one space without the need for segmentation.
 The process address space virtualizes the physical resource of memory,
 allowing processes to access memory indirectly through virtual addresses rather than directly addressing physical memory.
 
 PAGES AND PAGING :-
  Memory is composed of bits. 8 bit = 1 byte
  for more info look into the http://www.cs.rpi.edu/academics/courses/fall04/os/c12/#:~:text=Pages%20are%20typically%20512%20to,as%20the%20pages%20in%20memory.
  https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse378/10sp/lectures/lec16.pdf
  
  1 page = 4096 byte for 32 bit architecture 
  1 page = 8 kilo byte for 64 bit architecture
   page is a smallest addressable unit of memory that the memory management unit (mmu hardware) can manage.
  Thus the virtual address space is carved up into pages.
   note :  the page size is not part of the ABI
 
before going into virtaul address space lets clear some topics of paging.
 Sure! Let's explain spatial and temporal locality with a real-life example: reading a book.

Spatial Locality:
Imagine you are reading a physical book. When you read a specific page, you are likely to read the nearby pages as well.
 For example, if you are reading page 50 of a book, there's a good chance that you will read pages 49, 51,
 and perhaps even pages 48 and 52 in the near future.
 This is because the content of a book is typically organized in a sequential manner,
 and adjacent pages often contain related or continuation of the information you are currently reading.
 In this analogy, spatial locality is similar to the concept of caching.
 If you were to hold the book in your hand and wanted to read several pages in one sitting,
 you might place a bookmark near the page you are currently reading.
 This way, you don't have to flip through the entire book every time you want to continue reading;
 you can quickly return to the pages you've recently accessed.

Temporal Locality:
Continuing with the book example, let's say you're reading a particular chapter that you find interesting or challenging.
 You might read it once and then revisit it multiple times over the next few days to better understand the content
 or reinforce your understanding. In this case, you are exhibiting temporal locality.
Just as in spatial locality, the concept of caching is applicable here too.
 The more you revisit a specific chapter or section of the book,
 the more it makes sense to keep it "cached" in your mind so that you can quickly access it again without having to
 search through the entire book.

Now, let's relate these concepts to computer systems:

In computer systems, data is stored in memory (RAM),
 and accessing data from memory is much faster than accessing it from secondary storage (e.g., hard disk).
 Just like reading a book, when a program accesses a specific memory address,
 there is a good chance that it will access nearby memory addresses (spatial locality).
 To take advantage of this, modern computer architectures use caching mechanisms.
 When a CPU fetches data from main memory,
 it fetches not just the requested data but also a block of contiguous data (cache line) that includes nearby
 memory addresses. If the program subsequently accesses the nearby data,
 it can be retrieved quickly from the cache, which is much faster than accessing main memory.

Similarly, temporal locality is applied by keeping recently accessed data in the cache.
 If a program accesses a specific piece of data, it's likely that it will access the same data again in the near future.
 To avoid repeatedly fetching the same data from main memory,
 the CPU keeps a copy of the recently accessed data in the cache.
 If the program requests the same data again, it can be quickly retrieved from the cache,
 reducing the overall memory access time.

By utilizing spatial and temporal locality,
 caching mechanisms in computer systems improve memory access efficiency,
 reducing the need to access slower main memory frequently and speeding up program execution,
 just like the bookmark in a book allows you to quickly access specific pages without flipping through the entire book
 repeatedly.
 
 The idea behind virtual memory is that physical memory is divided into fixed size pages
 Page size is virtually always a power of two, for reasons to be explained below.
 LOADABLE MODULES ARE ALSO DIVIDED INTO A NUMBER OF PAGE FRAMES.Page frames are always the same size as the pages in memory.
	----------------------------------------
	| code segment      |page frame 1       |
	|					|page frame 2	   |
	|					|page frame 3	   |
	||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
	||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
	||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
	||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
	||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
	||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
	||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
	||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
	||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
	
Pages frames are loaded into memory only when they are needed.
Adjacent page frames are not necessarily loaded into adjacent pages in memory
At a point in time during the execution of a program, only a small fraction of the total pages of a process may be loaded.
Note that there are two kinds of addresses (or two address spaces), virtual addresses and real addresses.

more into paging concept :-
the paging concept in memory using a simple real-life example of a bookshelf and books.
Imagine your computer's memory is like a bookshelf,
and each book on the shelf represents a part of a program or application running on your computer.
Now, instead of directly putting the books on the shelves,you have a librarian who takes care of organizing the books
in a clever way.

1. Paging the Bookshelf (Physical frames) :
	To make the bookshelf more organized and efficient, the librarian decides to divide each bookshelf into equal-sized
	compartments. These compartments are fixed in size and called "frames."
	Each frame can hold one book at a time. So, if your bookshelf has ten compartments (frames),
	it can hold ten books simultaneously.
	These compartments represent the physical frames in our computer memory analogy (RAM)
	
2.Dividing the Books (Logical Pages):
	The librarian has various books that are too big to fit into a single compartment (frame).
	So, instead of trying to squeeze the entire book into one frame,
	the librarian divides each book into smaller parts.	These smaller parts are called "pages."
	and he took another book shelf similar to original frame and took pages from the respective books and organised
	Each page of the book fits perfectly into one frame on the bookshelf.
	These smaller pages represent the logical pages in our computer memory analogy (Virtual Address Space).
	
3. Keeping Track with Page Numbers (page table):
	To remember where each page of a book is placed on the bookshelf,
	the librarian maintains a special notebook called the "page table."
	In the page table, the librarian writes down the page number and the corresponding frame number where that page
	is stored on the bookshelf. So, whenever someone asks for a specific page of a book,
	the librarian can quickly look it up in the page table and find the corresponding frame on the bookshelf.	
	
4. Reading the Book:
	Now, imagine you want to read a specific book. You open the librarian's catalog and find the page number you need.
	Based on the page table, you know exactly which frame holds that page.
	You go to that frame, take out the page (book part), and read it.
	
5. Changing Books on the Bookshelf:
	As you read through the book, you may need to switch to another book.
	The librarian can easily swap out the current book's pages in the frames and replace them with the pages of the new book.
	This way, you always have access to the pages you need.
	
Note :- the librarian name is MMU.
Machine architecture decides the page size.

lets go into technical details:

Page Table data structure :-
 In computer memory management, a page table is a data structure used by the operating system to keep track of the mapping
 between logical addresses (virtual addresses) used by a process and their corresponding physical addresses in the 
 physical memory (RAM).
 When a program is executed, it operates in its own logical address space, which is divided into fixed-size blocks called
 pages. These pages are the smallest units of memory that the program can access.
 Similarly, the physical memory is divided into fixed-size blocks called frames.
 
 The page table maintains the mapping between the logical pages and their corresponding physical frames.
 Each entry in the page table corresponds to a page, and it contains the information needed to translate the logical address
 of a page to the physical address where the corresponding frame is located in the physical memory.
 
 When a process wants to access a specific memory address, the CPU looks up the page table to find the corresponding
 physical frame for that page. If the page is present in the physical memory (i.e., it is a valid page),
 the CPU translates the logical address to the correct physical address,
 and the data or instruction is fetched from the physical memory.
 
 However, if the page is not currently in the physical memory (i.e., it is an invalid page),
 it results in a page fault. The operating system handles this situation by loading the required page from secondary
 storage (e.g., hard disk) into an available frame in the physical memory and updates the page table to mark the page
 as valid. Once the page is in the memory, the CPU can complete the address translation and access the 
 desired data or instruction
 
Address Translation :
The process of converting a virtual address to a physical address is called Address Translation.
 The specific method used for address translation depends on the memory management scheme used by the operating system.
 Some common methods include Base and Bound, Segmentation, Paging, and Multilevel Translation.  
 When a process attempts to access a memory address, it uses a logical address (virtual address).
 The CPU, with the help of hardware called the Memory Management Unit (MMU), 
 translates this logical address into a physical address using the page table.
 The MMU looks up the page number from the logical address in the page table and retrieves the corresponding frame number,
 forming the physical address.
 
 The goals of address translation are:
- Memory protection (by limiting the access of a process to certain regions of memory)
- Memory sharing (e.g. shared libraries, interprocess communication)
- Sparse addresses (i.e. multiple regions of dynamic allocation such as heaps/stacks)
- Efficiency (e.g. memory placement, runtime lookup, compact translation tables)
- Portability (i.e. hardware independence)

Alignment :-

 In C programming, you can allocate memory dynamically using functions like malloc(), calloc(), and realloc().
 These functions return a pointer to a block of memory that you can use to store data. However, the memory that is returned may not be      
aligned  in a way that is suitable for all types of data.

For example, some processors require that 32-bit integers be aligned on a 4-byte boundary. This means that the memory address where the integer is stored must be a multiple of 4. If the integer is not aligned properly, the processor may have to perform extra work to access it, which can slow down the program. 
 
To avoid this problem, POSIX (a standard for operating systems) requires that the memory returned by malloc(), calloc(), and realloc() be properly aligned for use with any of the standard C types. On Linux, this means that the memory is aligned along at least an 8-byte boundary on 32-bit systems and at least a 16-byte boundary on 64-bit systems.

However, sometimes a programmer may need to allocate memory that is aligned along a larger boundary, such as a page. In this case, they can use the posix_memalign() function provided by POSIX 1003.1d. This function allows the programmer to specify the alignment of the memory they want to allocate. The function allocates size bytes of dynamic memory, ensuring it is aligned along a memory address that is a multiple of alignment. The parameter alignment must be a power of 2 and a multiple of the size of a void pointer.

 
posix_memalign() is a function provided by POSIX 1003.1d that allows a programmer to allocate memory that is aligned along a specific boundary. The function takes three arguments:

int posix_memalign (void **memptr,size_t alignment,size_t size);

void **memptr =  A pointer to a pointer that will receive the address of the allocated memory.
size_t alignment = The alignment of the memory, specified as a power of 2 and a multiple of the size of a void pointer.
size_t size = The size of the memory to allocate, in bytes.

If the function call fails, no memory is allocated, the pointer pointed to by the first argument is undefined, and the function returns an error code. The possible error codes are:

- EINVAL: The parameter alignment is not a power of 2 or is not a multiple of the size of a void pointer.
- ENOMEM: There is insufficient memory available to satisfy the requested allocation.

The memory obtained via posix_memalign() should be freed using the free() function.

eg :

char *buf;
int ret;
/* allocate 1 KB along a 256-byte boundary */
ret = posix_memalign (&buf, 256, 1024);
if (ret) {
fprintf (stderr, "posix_memalign: %s\n",
strerror (ret));
return −1;
}
/* use 'buf'... */
free (buf);

Managing the Data Segment :

Managing the Data Segment refers to the process of allocating and deallocating memory in the data segment of a process's virtual address space. 
The data segment, also known as the heap, is a segment of memory that contains a process's dynamic memory.
 This segment is writable and can grow or shrink in size.
 Unix systems provided interfaces for directly managing the data segment, such as the brk() and sbrk() functions. These functions were used to allocate and deallocate memory in the data segment. However, most programs have no direct use for these interfaces because malloc() and other allocation schemes are easier to use and more powerful.

Anonymous Memory Mappings :

Anonymous memory mappings are a way to allocate memory in a process's virtual address space without using the heap.
Anonymous memory mappings are created using the mmap() system call, which maps a region of memory into the process's address space.
The memory region is not backed by any file, hence the name "anonymous".

Anonymous memory mappings are useful for several reasons. First, they do not contribute to the fragmentation of the heap, which can be a concern in long-running programs that allocate and deallocate memory frequently. 
Second, anonymous memory mappings are resizable, have adjustable permissions, and can receive advice just like normal mappings.

Third, each allocation exists in a separate memory mapping, so there is no need to manage the global heap.

To create an anonymous memory mapping, the mmap() function	 is called with the MAP_ANONYMOUS and MAP_PRIVATE flags set.

Creating Anonymous Memory Mappings:-

#include <sys/mman.h>

       void *mmap(void *addr, size_t length, int prot, int flags,
                  int fd, off_t offset);
       int munmap(void *addr, size_t length);
	


Creating an anonymous memory mapping is actually easier than creating a file-backed
mapping, as there is no file to open and manage. The primary difference is the presence
of a special flag, signifying that the mapping is anonymous.

eg:-
	void *p;
	p = mmap (NULL,                   	/* do not care where */
		  512 * 1024,             	/* 512 KB */
		  PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, 	/* read/write */
		  MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_PRIVATE,  /* anonymous, private */
		  −1, 				/* fd (ignored) */
		  0); 				/* offset (ignored) */
		
		  if (p == MAP_FAILED)
		  perror ("mmap");
else
/* 'p' points at 512 KB of anonymous memory... */

The first parameter, start, is set to NULL, signifying that the anonymous mapping
may begin anywhere in memory that the kernel wishes. Specifying a non-NULL value
here is possible, so long as it is page-aligned, but limits portability. Rarely does a
program care where mappings exist in memory.

second parameter is size usually greater than 128kb

third parameter is The prot parameter usually sets both the PROT_READ and PROT_WRITE bits, making
the mapping readable and writable. An empty mapping is of no use if you cannot
read from and write to it. On the other hand, executing code from an anonymous
mapping is rarely desired, and allowing execution opens up an attack vector.

4th parameter is The flags parameter sets the MAP_ANONYMOUS bit, making this mapping anony‐
mous, and the MAP_PRIVATE bit, making this mapping private.

5th and 6th paramter is The fd and offset parameters are ignored when MAP_ANONYMOUS is set. Some older
systems, however, expect a value of −1 for fd, so it is a good idea to pass that if
portability is a concern.

One benefit to allocating from anonymous mappings is that the pages are
already filled with zeros. This occurs at no cost, because the kernel maps the application’s
anonymous pages to a zero-filled page via copy-on-write
